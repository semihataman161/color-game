# Color Game

Game Rules:
First, the difficulty level is requested from the user. Levels (3x3, 4x4, 5x5) are presented to the user. According to the difficulty level selected by the user, boxes of different colors are brought to the screen, each of which is placed in the form of a grid. In the upper corner of the screen, the color that the user should click and the remaining time information are displayed. Play time is 1 minute. The user will click on the color shown within 1 minute. After each correct click, all the colors in the grid will be randomly reassigned and the user will earn 10 points after each correct click. When the time is over, the user's score is shown in the game and the main screen is returned. This game will be played entirely on the client side. No HTTP request will be sent to the server.
